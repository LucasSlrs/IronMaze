First IronHack project: Create a video game in 5 days
I want to create a 3 dificulties mode maze game.
You have to finih the maze in time, but you need at least to collect 1 coin unless you will loose.
the hard mode will be in the dark and the player will have a small light to try solving the maze and collect coins.
